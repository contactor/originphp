
Welcome to the Origin PHP Framework!


VERSION
-------

This is a copy of 2.2 Release.


INTRODUCE
---------

Origin PHP Framework is a simple and fast PHP framework, pure OOP with a
flexible architecture. Itâ€™s based on MVC model and could be embedded into
other framework as Zend Framework.
Compare to other PHP framework, it's special and KISS (Keep It Simple and
Stupid). It's real PHP style framework, not java style, not ruby style, not C#
style. That is why I named it with the word Origin.
